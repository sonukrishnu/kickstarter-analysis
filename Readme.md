# Overview of Project

The purpose for this project is to compare that data between launch date and goals. We want to know how different campaigns affect the relation between the launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis 
* The overall the launch dates you can see it was very successful in May, and October has most of the failed campaigns.
* Based on Goal, most of the percentage successful rate who spent less than 1000, and most of the percentage failed rate was who spent between 45000 to 49999. 

  
### Challenges

* The difficulties I faced working on Outcomes Based on Goals, I was completely stuck doing that data. I read the instructions again and again to understand how I will find the number of successful, failed and canceled. 

#### Results (Theater Outcomes by Launch date)

* The campaign started in January and went through till December, but according to the chart I see that the campaign was most successful in May, and it had most failed rate in May and October. Also, there were very less canceled rate throughout the year. 

##### Results (Outcomes Based on Goals)

* According to the outcome based on goal chart, I see 75.81% were successful who spend less than 1000 and 66.67% were successful who spend between 40000 to 44999. 

###### Limitation of the dataset
* We can also create chart using number of successful, failed and canceled and compare the numbers that way. Right now, we just used percentages to see the results.
